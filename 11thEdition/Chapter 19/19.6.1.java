/* 
What is a raw type? Why is a raw type unsafe? Why is the raw type allowed in Java?


When you use generic type without specifying an actual parameter, it is called a raw type. 
A raw type is unsafe, because some errors cannot be detected by the compiler. 
The raw type is allowed in Java for backward compatibility.
